In this repo is an etch a sketch project I'll be making an etch a sketch using HTML/CSS and Javscript

Here is my foundational idea of how I will create this.

Within the HTML there will be a div, this div will have css styles attached to allow the amount of to be presented in a grid form. Such as 2x2 or 4x4.

The way these grid divs are created will be using a javascript loop, which takes a variable inputted (ie dimensions of grid or otherwise) and generate the amount
of needed divs to fulfill the disered dimensions. This will then fill out to match the dimensions properly.

Hover effect will be using pseduo classes in css with Javascript DOM manipulation changing it with the color

Button for asking for number of squares per side for new grid will be linked to the variable for the looping to create the divs.
 Once done the existing grid should be removed. Use a logic statement to ensre its not about 100.
